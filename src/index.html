        <h4>👀 Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Ḥajj is a journey that Muslims undertake to Mecca commemorating the spirit of devotion to God (Allāh) performed by Prophet Abraham [Ibrāhīm] and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          It entails visiting Mecca from the 8th-12th of the lunar calendar month of Dhul Ḥijjah and performing rituals at other nearby regions in emulation of Prophet Abraham.
        </p>

        <h4>📖 The Backstory</h4>
        <p class="fullText">
          Mecca is a sacred city in the Arabian Peninsula which was first inhabited by Ishmael [Ismāʿīl], and his parents, Hagar [Hājar], and Abraham.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="preview">Prophet Abraham was instructed by God to leave Hagar and son in this barren valley as a test to see whether he and his family were willing to endure their tribulations by placing their trust in God.</span><span class="fullText"> They had to trust that God would provide for them in this hot and uninhabited land, lacking food and water, with no vegetation for shade.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="fullText">
          By understanding that God is the ultimate source of all provisions, they were able to pass the test and were ultimately relieved of all their hardships. As a reward, God made the region of Mecca a special place which would become the center for monotheism until the end of times.

        <h4>✒️ Significance</h4>
        <p class="fullText">
          Mecca has immense historical and religious value because Prophet Muhammad lived there for most of his life, and the first thirteen years of the revelation of the Qurān occurred there.
        </p>
        <p class="preview">
          Mecca’s religious merit lies primarily in the fact that it contains the Kaʿbah 🕋, which all Muslims around the world face towards during ritual prayer.
        </p>
        <p class="fullText">
          After Abraham’s return to Mecca, God instructed him and his son, Ishmael, to construct the structure of the Kaʿbah, the first place dedicated entirely to the worship of one God alone.
        </p>
        <p class="fullText">
          The Ka’bah represents the focal point of all Muslim worship and the unity of the Muslim community across the world. Muslims don’t pray to the Ka’bah, but rather prayer to the Lord of the Ka’bah.
        </p>
        <p class="fullText">
          Since Abraham’s time, people have been visiting the once-empty valley for thousands of years. Muslims are the latest in a long line of prophets and religious followers to direct their worship to the Ka’bah.

        <h4>😇 Virtues</h4>
        <p class="fullText">
          Ḥajj has the potential of being one of the most rewarding acts of worship a Muslim can ever perform. Muslims endure the crowding and the heat in order to gain the pleasure and reward of God.
        </p>
        <p class="fullText">
          The Prophet Muhammad (may God bless and preserve his legacy) said, "Whoever performs Ḥajj sincerely for God and avoids obscenity and sins will return from the journey like the day his mother gave birth to him [i.e. with no sins].”
        </p>
        <p class="preview">
          The Prophet also taught Muslims that, "the only reward of an accepted Ḥajj is Paradise"

        <h4>🤗 What to Expect</h4>
        <p>
          During Ḥajj, the migrants fulfill a grooming ritual which involves the men shaving their heads, and the women trimming their hair.

                  Muslims only have to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca <strong>once in their lifetime</strong>, and they only have to do so if they have the financial means and physical health to get there and perform the tasks. However, there are many Muslims who choose to go multiple times, and some go every single year!

                  Ḥajj is an obligation at least once in a lifetime for <strong>Muslims who are able to go</strong>. Children, mentally handicapped, financially unable and physically unable people are exempted from performing Ḥajj. Many people save up their entire lives for this one event though there is no blame on them if they never accumulate enough savings to go.

                  Muslims look to Muhammad (may God bless and preserve his legacy) as their primary guide and teacher in this world. However, <strong>the Islamic tradition recognizes several other prophets</strong>. The Qurān is filled with lessons from the lives of other prophets of God. These include, but aren’t limited to: Abraham, Noah, Jonas, Job, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus (May God preserve all their legacies). Muslims believe that Prophet Muhammad taught the pure and unadulterated rituals originially performed by Abraham, so Muslims are following both Abraham and Muhammad in this act.

                  Saudi Arabia has invested heavily into the infrastructure surrounding the rituals of Ḥajj, so the potential dangers of being around millions of people has been significantly reduced. The pathways are paved, the lodgings are air conditioned, and there are signs and escorts to guide everyone throughout the pilgrimage.

                  <strong>"Allāh," is the Arabic for "The God."</strong> Allāh is referring to Himself as "the one and only God," but as a proper noun. Additionally, this is how Allāh addresses Himself in the Qurān, so Muslims like to use the name God gave for Himself over other translations and names.
